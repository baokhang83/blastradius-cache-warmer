# Session: SliceCache interface + SliceCacheException

- **intent:** SliceCache interface + SliceCacheException
- **started:** 2026-08-07

<!--
FluencyLoop Stage 3 — a session is a slice of the build. It holds two persistent records:
  1. Knowledge transfer — what the developer was made fluent in this slice (you write it).
  2. Decisions — the genuine forks, appended by `fluencyloop decision` (the script formats them).

Everything below is scaffolding in comments — nothing to delete. Write knowledge transfer under
its headings; add each decision with
  fluencyloop decision --where <file/area> --why <rationale> [--alternative <rejected + why>] \
                       [--title <chose X over Y>] [--constitution §N] [--trust verified|unverified]
so the block is formatted deterministically and you never hand-write the bullet schema. No
`commits:` field: the feature is a branch, so the PR view derives commits live from git.

KNOWLEDGE-TRANSFER — one bullet per component/role/mechanism explained:
  **<subject>** — <what it does, under what conditions> · status: documented | follow-up
  Make it RICH: cover the inventory AND the non-obvious, hard-won lessons (a bug's root cause,
  why something is done an odd way, a documented limitation). Describe the WORK, never a person
  (no competence, no "who knew what") — these files are committed and name an author via git.

DECISION fields (assembled by `fluencyloop decision`):
  where        — file/area (NOT a line number — survives refactoring)
  why          — the rationale, taught live before it was written
  alternative  — the rejected option and why (what makes it rationale, not description)
  design       — (optional) ../design.md#anchor
  constitution — (optional) §N
  trust        — ✓ verified | ⚠ not independently verified (about the DECISION, never the person)

## Knowledge transfer

_The ground this slice makes understandable — components, roles, and conditions explained,
persisted so the fluency doesn't evaporate with the conversation. About the work, never a person._

### Components (role, conditions)

- **`SliceCache`** — the two-method interface every backend (S3 now, GitHub Actions cache later,
  T14) implements: `Optional<byte[]> fetch(key)` and `void put(key, data)`. Storage-agnostic and
  payload-agnostic by design - it never learns what a slice's bytes represent, which is what lets
  T5-T7 swap backends without any tier-warmer code changing · status: documented
- **`SliceCacheException`** — the single failure type both methods can throw; always names the
  operation and key alongside the underlying cause's message · status: documented

### Hard-won conditions (gotchas, root causes, limitations)

- **A clean miss is never an exception** — `fetch` returning `Optional.empty()` and `fetch`
  throwing are deliberately different signals a caller must be able to tell apart (see the
  `NoSuchKeyException` decision in session 002, where this distinction gets implemented)
  · status: documented

<!-- Decisions are appended below by `fluencyloop decision`. For reference, a block looks like:
## Decision: chose X over Y
- **where:** `path/to/File.ext`
- **why:** the one-line why, engaged with — not post-hoc narration
- **alternative:** the rejected option — rejected: why
- **trust:** ⚠ not independently verified
